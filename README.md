#  Raspberry Pi Oximeter

This project is a **pulse oximeter** implemented in **C** running on a **Raspberry Pi W**.  
It measures **blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂)** and **heart rate**, providing **visual and audible alerts** based on the readings.  
The project is designed to run on the **BitDogLab platform**.



##  Features

-  **SpO₂ Measurement** – Accurately measures oxygen saturation levels in the blood.  
-  **Heart Rate Monitoring** – Tracks beats per minute (BPM).  
-  **Visual Indicators**  
  - Green LED: Normal readings  
  - Red LED: Abnormal readings  
-  **Audible Alert** – Buzzer activates if readings are outside normal range.  
-  **Raspberry Pi W Integration** – Fully functional on a low-cost, compact device.  



##  Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi W**  
- **Pulse oximeter sensor module** (compatible with Raspberry Pi)  
- **LEDs** (green and red)  
- **Buzzer**  
- Connecting wires and breadboard (optional)
